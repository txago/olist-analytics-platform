## 📈 Sample Insights

### Customer Segmentation Analysis (2016-2018 Dataset)

**Critical Discovery:** Analysis reveals severe customer retention challenges:

| Segment | Customers (%) | Revenue | Avg Value | Status |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Recent Customers** | 23,716 (24.64%) | R$ 3.1M | R$ 133 | Bought recently, watching |
| **Promising** | 23,735 (24.47%) | R$ 1.2M | R$ 54 | Recent activity emerging |
| **Loyal Customers** | 19,295 (20%) | R$ 8.2M | R$ 425 | Consistent buyers |
| **Customers Needing Attention** | 14,857 (15.46%) | R$ 0.8M | R$ 54 | Used to purchase, warning signs detected |
| **Potential Loyalists** | 14,875 (15.43%) | R$ 2M | R$ 132 | Recent promising buyers |

**Key Business Finding:**
- **Average frequency = 1.0 across ALL segments** → 97%+ single-purchase customers
- Only 3% of customers returned for a second order
- Revenue concentration: Top 20% (Loyal) = 53% of total revenue (R$ 8.2M)
- Massive opportunity: Converting 10% to repeat = R$ 1.5M+ additional revenue
- Loyal Customers (20%) have fewer customers but have 3x higher value, generating R$ 8.2M total. Considering that 49% of customers are in early-stage segments (Recent + Promising), there is a huge opportunity to add R$ 440K in revenue by converting just 10% of these to Loyal Customers.
- The absence of Champions and high churn rate indicates the business struggled with retention in 2016-2018. This analysis demonstrates how ML can identify such problems early, enabling proactive intervention.

### Churn Prediction Results (180-Day Window)

**Model Performance:**
- **AUC-ROC:** 99.8% - Near-perfect predictive accuracy
- **Churn Rate:** 59.7% of customers inactive 180+ days  
- **Calibration:** Predicted 59.36% vs Actual 59.69% (excellent match)

**Risk Distribution:**
- **High Risk (Top 20%):** 19,200 customers - R$ 3.1M revenue at risk
- **Medium Risk (Next 30%):** 28,800 customers - R$ 4.8M revenue at risk
- **Low Risk (Bottom 50%):** 48,096 customers - Stable base

**Business Value:** Early identification enables proactive retention. With R$ 7.9M at risk (High + Medium), investing R$ 2.4M in retention campaigns (R$ 50/customer) with 30% success rate yields R$ 2.37M savings = 99% ROI.

The 59.7% churn rate reflects the dataset period (2016-2018) where Olist experienced significant customer retention challenges. The model's 99.8% AUC demonstrates it can accurately identify at-risk customers, enabling targeted retention interventions that could have reduced this churn rate by 15-20% through proactive campaigns.

**Technical Achievement:** Random Forest classifier with 100 trees achieved near-perfect discrimination between churned and active customers, with key predictive features being recency (days since last order), delivery performance, and review scores.

### Product Performance
**Top revenue** 
1. Health & Beauty: R$ 1.25M (9.58%)
2. Watches & Gifts: R$ 1.20M (9%)
3. Bed, Bath & Table: R$ 1.04M (7.7%)
4. Sports & Leisure: R$ 988K (7.4%)
5. Computer Accessories: R$ 912K (6.8%)

3. Agro Industry and Commerce: R$ 342.12
4. Musical Instruments: R$ 281.62
5. Small Appliances: R$ 280.78
